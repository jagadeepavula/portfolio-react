    moreDetails: `<h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">Problem Statement</h3>
        <p class="text-2xl font-thin">In my previous project, I encountered an issue where I needed to create direct download links for files stored in Google Drive. This was crucial for seamlessly integrating audio file downloads into my project. However, manually creating these links was cumbersome and not scalable, especially when working on multiple projects simultaneously.</p><br/>
        
        <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">Solution Overview</h3>
        <p class="text-2xl font-thin">To address this challenge, I developed a Drive link generator using JavaServer Pages (JSP) within the Eclipse IDE. The goal was to automate the process of converting Google Drive file links into direct download links, enabling smoother file access for my projects.</p><br/>
        
        <h3 class="text-3xl font-bold">Technical Implementation</h3>
        <p class="text-2xl font-thin">Dynamic Web Project Setup: I utilized Eclipse IDE to set up a Dynamic Web Project, providing a structured environment for web application development.</p><br/>

        <p class="text-2xl font-thin">I designed a user-friendly interface using HTML and JSP, allowing users to input their Google Drive file links easily.</p><br/>
        
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold">Backend Logic (Servlet):</h4> 
        <p class="text-2xl font-thin">A Java Servlet was implemented to handle user requests. This servlet processed the input Drive link and executed the necessary logic to convert it into a downloadable link.</p><br/>
        
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold">Conversion Logic:</h4> 
        <p class="text-2xl font-thin">The core logic for converting Drive links was encapsulated in a separate Java class. This modular approach ensured efficient code management and reusability.</p><br/>
        
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold">Error Handling:</h4> 
        <p class="text-2xl font-thin">Robust error handling mechanisms were integrated to validate input links and redirect users in case of invalid inputs, ensuring a seamless user experience.</p><br/>
        
        <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold">Result Presentation:</h4> 
        <p class="text-2xl font-thin">Upon successful conversion, users were presented with the direct download link, enhancing accessibility and usability.</p><br/>
